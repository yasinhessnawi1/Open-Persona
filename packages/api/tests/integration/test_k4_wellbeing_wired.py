"""K4 criteria 2 / 4 / 5 — the wellbeing layer end to end on the real stack.

Drives the EXACT K4 path the chat loop composes (``make_graph_retrieval`` with the K4
allowlist provider over the real graph store + ``HybridRetriever``), against real
Postgres + pgvector + the real ``bge-small`` embedder. Proves the behaviours the unit
tests can only simulate:

- **Criterion 2 (share-with-care flows):** a disordered-eating disclosure (share-with-
  care, NEVER gated) reaches the prompt carrying its ``wellbeing_category`` (so K3's
  surfacing slot attaches the care text); untagged knowledge flows untouched.
- **Criterion 4 (context gating holds + lifts):** a gate-eligible crisis disclosure is
  SUBTRACTED from the per-turn allowlist on an unrelated, unopened turn (the gate
  holds), and SURFACES when the user opens the topic (the gate lifts).
- **Criterion 5 (never-store, retrieval side):** a means/method disclosure recorded via
  the real ``record_user_fact`` tool is rejected at the write (D-K2-7) and its specifics
  are NOT retrievable from the graph, while the care-relevant fact IS. (The write-side
  rejection is also covered by ``test_k2_direct_write_operator_pass``; here it is K4's
  "no method content retrievable from the graph" wording, end to end.)

``@pytest.mark.integration`` so it is out of the default unit run. Mirrors
``test_k3_cross_persona_wired`` (seeding, RLS binding, the wired store). Run against an
ISOLATED database (a distinct ``PERSONA_TEST_DB_NAME`` for this worktree) — do not run
concurrently with other specs' integration close-out (shared-DB contention).

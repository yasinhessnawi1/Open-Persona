"""Retry / backoff / dead-letter tests (Spec A0, T6) — criterion 5.

Against real Postgres. Proves: a transient handler failure schedules a retry with
capped-exponential backoff (T1 ``RetryPolicy.backoff_for``); exhaustion
dead-letters durably as ``dead`` with the cause and is queryable; a
``PermanentJobError`` terminates as ``failed`` (distinct from ``dead``); and the
caps hold (no retry storm — a dead/failed job is never re-claimed; a crash-loop
re-claim past the cap dead-letters without running).

"""The WIRED synthesis pipeline — end-to-end against real Postgres (Spec K2, T8d).

Proves the activated consumer: enqueue a ``synthesis`` job → the worker claims it
→ the :class:`SynthesisHandler` (composed by the worker root via
``register_synthesis_handler`` over the real ``build_synthesizer`` + real
``PgSynthesisRepository`` + real ``PostgresGraphStore``) windows the conversation,
runs the synthesizer on a CHEAP fake backend (the plumbing — not the model), and:

- advances the ``synthesis_markers`` high-water-mark (idempotency marker), AND
- writes the extracted fact into ``graph_nodes``, owner-scoped (RLS holds).

A re-delivery of the same job is a marker no-op (no duplicate graph write). This is
the plumbing leg — the model-quality gate is the separate ``@pytest.mark.external``
extraction eval re-run on the wired tier.

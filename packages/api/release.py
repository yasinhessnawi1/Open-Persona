"""Fly ``release_command``: migrate the DB to head + (re)grant ``persona_app``.

Runs once per deploy in the release VM (the built image + the app's secrets),
BEFORE the new version is promoted to serve traffic — and a non-zero exit
**aborts the deploy**, so a failed or missing migration can never ship code
against an un-migrated DB. This replaces the manual ``FLY_DEPLOY.md`` §4b step
(``flyctl ssh console -C "alembic upgrade head"`` + grants), which was easy to
forget — a missed run shipped code querying ``messages.originated`` against a DB
that lacked the column, 500-ing every conversation page.

This is NOT on container *start* (Spec 07 §7's concern — that would re-run on
every machine restart and race across machines): ``release_command`` is a single
deliberate deploy-time step, which honours §7's "explicit, not per-restart" rule
while removing the footgun.

``DATABASE_URL`` is the **superuser** DSN (the request path uses
``APP_DATABASE_URL`` as the non-superuser ``persona_app`` role); migrations
(``CREATE TABLE``/``POLICY``) and the grants both need superuser. Both steps are
idempotent — re-running on a no-new-migration deploy is a clean no-op.

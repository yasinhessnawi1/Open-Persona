"""T6 — the voice graph posture (D-K3-6): tighter profile, overlapped or skipped.

The load-bearing lock proven, not asserted: graph-awareness on a voice turn adds
**zero serial wall-clock** to the pre-model path. The proof uses REAL wall-clock
timing (the same rigor as the T5 budget measurement) through the actual
:class:`FirstTokenLatencyTracker` — a graph query that overlaps V5's pre-model
window is free, one that overruns is dropped (graph-off), and a hypothetical
serial leg would be visibly larger in the tracker. The voice profile (traversal
off + raised floor + small node budget) is distinct; the chat profile is intact.

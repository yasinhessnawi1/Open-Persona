"""K3-D-6 — the voice graph posture: a tighter profile, overlapped or skipped.

Voice has no TTFT slack — V5 measured first-token ~1607 ms, already over the
~600 ms gate (V5 close-out). So graph-awareness on a voice turn must add **zero
serial wall-clock** to the pre-model path. Two halves, one mechanism (Spec 18
profile philosophy — the standard chat profile from T2–T5 is untouched; voice
gets the tighter slice):

1. **The profile** (:func:`voice_graph_settings` + :data:`VOICE_NODE_BUDGET`):
   traversal OFF (the cheapest big latency win — no neighbour-expansion hops), a
   raised relevance floor (fewer, surer nodes under pressure), and a small node
   budget.
2. **Overlap-or-skip** (:func:`start_graph_retrieval` + :func:`take_graph_if_ready`):
   the query is kicked off in a worker thread at turn onset so it runs
   CONCURRENTLY with V5's existing pre-model work, and its result is taken **only
   if it already finished** by prompt-assembly time. A query that overruns the
   window is dropped for that turn (the turn proceeds **graph-off**) — never
   awaited on the critical path. So graph-awareness on voice is either free
   (overlapped) or absent (skipped), never a tax.

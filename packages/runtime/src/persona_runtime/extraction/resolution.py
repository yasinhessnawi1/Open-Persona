"""Entity resolution orchestration (Spec K2, T3; the D-K0-9 seam).

K0's ``EntityRegistry.resolve`` is deterministic and LLM-free: it returns a
three-way verdict (``MERGE`` / ``SEPARATE`` / ``AMBIGUOUS``). This runtime
orchestrator owns the parts K0 leaves to K2:

- ``MERGE``  → use the canonical id (K0 is confident — never re-judged, D-K0-9).
- ``SEPARATE`` → ``create_entity`` (confidently new).
- ``AMBIGUOUS`` → run the LLM judge (:class:`persona.extraction.EntityRecognizer`)
  on that band ONLY; on confirmation ``add_alias`` and reuse the id, on rejection
  ``create_entity``.

Turning an interaction's raw entity mentions into resolved canonical ``entity_ids``
is what threads concepts to one entity instead of fragments — the alias-heavy
"my doctor… Dr. Hansen… she…" case (criterion 3). Resolution runs in ONE pass over
the interaction's mentions so the registry accumulates within the pass: a variant
surface seen after its entity exists reaches the review band and collapses onto it.

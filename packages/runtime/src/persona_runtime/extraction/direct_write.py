"""The direct-write capability — ``record_user_fact`` (Spec K2, T7; D-K2-1).

A Spec-03 ``AsyncTool`` available to all personas by default: the persona invokes
it mid-interaction to record an explicit, discrete, durable fact about the user
(the way a good assistant jots a note). The persona's in-context judgement IS the
extraction — so the tool does NO LLM work; it builds one ``KnowledgeCandidate``
and runs ONE inline ``GraphStore.merge`` (canonicalise → extend-vs-create → link →
index-sync). A single merge is tens of ms, so the write is fire-and-forget from
the turn's perspective — it never blocks or slows the reply (criterion 10). The
immediacy is the point (the next persona, minutes later, should know the fact);
enqueuing would reintroduce the gap the direct path exists to close.

Grounding rides for free: the persona is asserting the user conveyed the fact, so
the fact itself is the provenance grounding (``source = persona_self``). Entity
threading and the emergent understanding are synthesis's job (T8) — the direct
write is for the discrete fact, now.

The ``@tool`` decorator's envelope turns any body exception into
``ToolResult(is_error=True)`` (D-03-5), so a merge failure surfaces as an error
result and never crashes the live turn.
